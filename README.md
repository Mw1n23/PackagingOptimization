## 3D Bin Packing Visualization

This Python script uses the `py3dbp` library to pack items into a storage unit and visualizes the result in a 3D plot using Matplotlib. The script simulates packing 100 battery items ("Akkus") into a storage unit and displays their arrangement with a color-coded legend.

### Features
- **Bin Packing**: Utilizes the `py3dbp` library to pack items into a defined storage unit (`Tiefk√ºhler`).
- **3D Visualization**: Renders a 3D plot of packed items with random colors for each item.
- **Legend**: Includes a dynamic legend mapping item names to their respective colors.
- **Output**: Prints details of fitted and unfitted items for analysis.
